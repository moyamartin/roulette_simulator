Roulette++ is a Casino \mbox{\hyperlink{classRoulette}{Roulette}} Simulator written in C++11 which follows the next rules\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The roulette has 37 numbers (0 -\/ 36)
\item The player can only make simple bets (red, black, even, odd, high, low)
\item The number 0 is a special number. When the roulette outputs this mean that the people who made a simple bet has lost (in this case, everyone).
\item If the player has won a simple bet. The dealer pays the double of what the player has bet. i.\+e. \mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} A bets 10 units, the dealer pays 20 (bet + earnings). Otherwise, the dealer keeps with the bet, in this case, \mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} A has lost 10 units.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For this simulation the table limits is of maximum 4000 units and minimum 5 units. Every player of the simulation has a list of every bet, and begins with the following sequence\+:

1 -\/ 2 -\/ 3 -\/ 4

The current bet is a sum of the beginning and the end of the list. i.\+e. first bet of \mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} A would be 1 + 4 = 5. If the player has won, then he add the last bet to the end of the list and sums it to the current balance, thus the list would be\+:

1 -\/ 2 -\/ 3 -\/ 4 -\/ 5

Otherwise, the player deletes the first and last values and extracts the latter bet to the current balance, in this case the list would end up being\+:

2 -\/ 3

The players have an unlimited amount of money, so when the bet excedes the maximum bet or is lower than the minimum bet or even does not have any bet left on the list, it is automatically re established to its original sequence (1 -\/ 2 -\/ 3 -\/ 4).

For testing purposes, the program is fixed with six players (\mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} A, \mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} B, \mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} C, \mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} D, \mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} E and \mbox{\hyperlink{classPlayer}{Player}} F), these players always make the same simple bet (red, black, high, low, even, odd respectively) and the simulation runs 10000 times showing on each run the sum of all the player\textquotesingle{}s balance.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Build and run}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
